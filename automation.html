    <h1 class = dataheading> DEVELOPMENT AND AUTOMATION </h1>
    <div class = auto>
    <p> My main experience is on the development side. I have had the opportunity to create full webpages along with a few of my classmates as seen 
        <a href =https://katays.github.io/a3web/ target="_blank">here</a> as well as in this portfolio page. I have been able to gain experience working with API's 
         particularly the Esri JavaScript API as seen in <a href = https://katays.github.io/pl3/application.html target="_blank"> this example </a> of a interactive map made for elementary school 
         students to learn about the provices and territories in Canada with the source code found in my <a href = https://github.com/katays/pl3/blob/main/application.html target="_blank">respository</a>. 
         It can also be seen in <a href = https://katays.github.io/pl2/custom.html target="_blank"> this example </a> where I plot an area of interest based on ditectional coordinates.
          On the cartogrphic side I have also been able to work with Leaflet JS to create 
        clean mobile friendly <a href = https://katays.github.io/pl3/leafletTutorialJS.html target="_blank">maps</a>. This map also encourges interactivity from the user with 
        the opportunity to choose froma variety of basemaps pulled from the leaflet library. </p>

    <p> 
       On the automation side of things I have been able to gain experience in writing Python scripts with a team to create a Biodiversity Index Calculator which 
       can be found <a href = https://github.com/katays/calculator target="_blank">here</a>. I also have extensive experience using the ArcPy module within Python to automate processes such as creating new 
       layers, or changing symbology of maps as a batch task.
