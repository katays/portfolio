    <h1 class = dataheading> MAPS PORTFOLIO</h1>
    <p class = caption> This is a collection of some of the maps that I have created over the course of my academic term at Fleming. These 
        maps were all created using ArcGIS Pro. The data that they represent is derived either through my own data acquisiton through
        open source resources or are the result of spatial and remote sensing analysis that I have conducted.
