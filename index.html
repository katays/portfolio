        <p> I am a GIS Applications Specialist student at Fleming College with a background in environmental conservation. 
            I am particularly interested in working with spatial data through it's entire lifecycle from collection to visual representation. 
            My time at Fleming has given me an opportunity to gain experience in: 
              </p>
        <ul>
            <li class = dblist > Creation of interactive web maps as well as print maps that abide by 
                cartographic conventions </li>
            <li class = dblist> Efficient organization and data preparation for a GIS as well as the ability to 
                query this data for retrieval, calculation, manipulation or conducting the ETL 
                process</li>
            <li class = dblist>Performing spatial analysis using appropriate data models and geoprocessing 
                techniques and present findings in a professional manner</li>
            <li class = dblist> Workflow automation using Python, specifically the ArcPy module</li>
            <li class = dblist>Understanding basic remote sensing principles and extracting information from 
                imagery </li>
        </ul>
